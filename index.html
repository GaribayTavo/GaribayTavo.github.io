        <p>"My interest in public art and access to fine art and literature have informed my research within the Lowriding community of Los Angeles from 1955 to 1985, where it transformed and was utilized for social, political and economic reasons, developing into a cultural export from the disenfranchised Mexican American communities that began investing in their interests before the arrival of civil rights for minorities in the United States. The link leads to a YouTube video and it was published by kideuce. It depicts a group of young males in the 1980s, driving down WHittier Boulevard, depicted in the sign in the image, which was published by Lowrider Magazine online."
